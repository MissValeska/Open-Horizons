Open-Horizons
===============

A game of realism and simulation!

This is a game using the Irrlicht Engine,

http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/

Open Horizons has very ambitons, Yet, I think, Obtainable goals, Such as a simulation based health system, Rather than hit point based. I.E Instead of having a set number of blood "points" which is exactly the same for everyone, Which are removed by an exact amount based on actions which always happen in the same way, (I.E being shot in a certian place) Blood, For example, In Open Horizons, Would be simulated with liquid dynamics. So, A heart pumps which is governed by physics, Not something that was contrived. Blood flows according to liquid dynamics, And spills out according to liquid dynamics, In conjunction with blood cloats to stop the bleeding. All governed by liquid dynamics, And physics. All realistic, All unique.

If you enjoy soft body physics in racing games, You'll LOVE Open Horizons!

Please note: Open Horizons is currently in unbelievely early pre-alpha, If you are looking for examples of what I have explained above, You will have to wait for a little while longer. I'm sorry. :(
